# KubeflowDojo
Repository to hold code, instructions, demos and pointers to presentation assets for [Kubeflow](https://github.com/kubeflow) Dojo.

With the breadth of sheer functionalities which need to be addressed in the Machine Learning world around building, training, serving and managing models, getting it done in a consistent, composable, portable, and scalable manner is hard. The Kubernetes framework is well suited to address these issues, which is why itâ€™s a great foundation for deploying ML workloads. Kubeflow is designed to take advantage of these benefits. 

In this Dojo, we are going to address how to  make it easy for everyone to develop, deploy, and manage portable, scalable ML everywhere and support the full lifecycle Machine Learning using Kubeflow. We are going to discuss how to deploy and manage Kubeflow, and detail how to enable distributed training of models, model serving, canary rollouts, drift detection, model explainability, metadata management, pipelines and others.
