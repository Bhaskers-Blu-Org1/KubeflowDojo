# KubeflowDojo
Repository to hold code, instructions, demos and pointers to presentation assets for [Kubeflow](https://github.com/kubeflow) Dojo. In this Dojo, we are going to address how to  make it easy for everyone to develop, deploy, and manage portable, scalable ML everywhere and support the full lifecycle Machine Learning using [Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/). We are going to discuss how to deploy and manage Kubeflow, and detail how to enable distributed training of models, model serving, canary rollouts, drift detection, model explainability, metadata management, pipelines and others.
